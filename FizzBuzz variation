Problem: Print numbers from 1 to N. For multiples of 3 print "Fizz", for multiples of 5 print "Buzz", and for both, print "FizzBuzz".
solution:
def fizz_buzz(n):
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)

fizz_buzz(15)

✅ What does this program do?
It prints numbers from 1 to n (in this case 15), but:
For numbers divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz"
For numbers divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz"
For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz"
Otherwise, it prints the number itself

Line-by-line Explanation:
1. def fizz_buzz(n):
This defines a function named fizz_buzz that takes one input n.

2. for i in range(1, n + 1):
Loops from 1 to n (inclusive). So if n = 15, it goes from 1 to 15.

3. if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
% means modulus (remainder).

This checks if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (e.g., 15).

If true, print "FizzBuzz".

4. elif i % 3 == 0:
If divisible by 3 (but not 5), print "Fizz".

5. elif i % 5 == 0:
If divisible by 5 (but not 3), print "Buzz".

6. else:
If not divisible by 3 or 5, just print the number.

7. fizz_buzz(15)
Calls the function with n = 15.

✅ Output:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
