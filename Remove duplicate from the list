Problem : write a program to remove the duplicates from a list.

solution:
def remove_duplicates(lst):
    return list(set(lst))
print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]))

explanation:
def remove_duplicates(lst):
def means: define a function.
remove_duplicates is the name of the function.
lst is the input â€” it stands for list.                    

    return list(set(lst))
set(lst) removes duplicate values from the list.
Example: set([1, 2, 2, 3]) â†’ {1, 2, 3}
A set only keeps unique items.
What is a set in Python?                                                                 *** if we want the output in the form of list then we have to use return list(set(list))
ðŸ”¸ A set is a built-in data type that:                                                      but if we have to remove only duplicate and return output in set the we use return set(list)
Stores multiple items like a list.                                                                      
Does NOT allow duplicates.
Is unordered â€” the items donâ€™t have a fixed position.

list(...) converts the set back into a list.
So you can use it like a normal list again.

print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]))
Output:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
