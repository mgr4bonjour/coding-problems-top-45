problem : write a program to find the longest word in an sentence.

solution:
def longest_word(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    return max(words, key=len)
print(longest_word('I wrote this code in python programming language'))

explanation:

 def longest_word(sentence):

def: Defines a function.
longest_word: Name of the function.
sentence: A parameter — the input sentence.

words = sentence.split()
sentence.split() splits the sentence into a list of words.
For example: "I love programming" → ["I", "love", "programming"]

 return max(words, key=len)
max() finds the word with the maximum length.
key=len tells Python to compare items by their length.

print(longest_word("I wrote this code in python programming language"))
gives the output 'programming'
