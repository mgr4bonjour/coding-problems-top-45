Problem : write a program to find a factorial of a number.

solution:
def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n - 1)
print(factorial(4))

explanation:
def factorial(n):
def: Keyword to define a function.

factorial: Name of the function.

(n): Parameter n, the number whose factorial we want.

return 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n - 1)
return: Sends back the result.

1 if n == 0: This is the base case. If n is 0, return 1 (because 0! = 1).

else: If not 0, go to the recursive part.

n * factorial(n - 1): Multiply n by the factorial of n-1. This keeps calling the function again until n reaches 0.

print(factorial(4))
this line gives an output 24
because factorial of 4 is 4*3*2*1 = 24
