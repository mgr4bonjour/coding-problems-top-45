problem : write a program to reverse a number.
solution :

def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
print(reverse(2,4,3,7,4))

Explanation: 
def: This is a Python keyword used to define a function.

reverse_string: This is the name of the function. It tells us what the function is supposed to doâ€”reverse a string.
(s): This is the parameter list. Here, the function accepts one argument, which will be referred to as s inside the function.
:: This indicates the start of the function body.

return s[::-1]
return: This keyword sends back a value from the function to wherever it was called.
s: This is the parameter passed to the function. It is expected to be a string.
[::-1]: This is a slicing operation in Python that reverses the string.
Syntax: [start:stop:step]
Here:
start and stop are omitted (default to the whole string),
step = -1, which means go backwards by 1 character at a time (i.e., reverse).

print(reverse(2,4,3,7,4))
print(...): This prints the result of whatever is inside the parentheses.
reverse(2,4,3,7,4): This tries to call a function named reverse, passing in 5 arguments: 2, 4, 3, 7, 4.
