## Problem: Write a function to determine if a given string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces and punctuation,
solution:
import string

def is_palindrome(s):
    cleaned = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
    return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]

print(is_palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"))

**Explanation:**
palindrome - greek word
palin means back
and drome means running 
**palindrome = running back**
import string -This line import python`s built-in string module.3 

def is_palindrome(s)
**def means defining the function in python
**is_palindrome is then function name which is depends on you 
the main  otive of give this name is to check the number is palindrome or not because is in is_palindrome means true/false.
we also give check_palindrome and others.
**(s) means that the functions takes one input as a string.

 cleaned = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())
 **cleaned is a new variable that will store the cleaned-up version of the string.  the cleaned-up version of a string, which means some transformation has been applied to remove unwanted characters like punctuation, extra spaces, special symbols, etc.
**  '' (empty string) is used to join all the characters together.
**  .join(...) combines all valid characters into one string.
**  char.lower() → Converts each character to lowercase, so uppercase/lowercase don’t matter.
**   for char in s → Loops through each character in the input string s
for: This is the keyword that starts a loop.
char: This is the loop variable. On each iteration of the loop, it takes the value of the next character in the string.
in s: This means you're looping over the string s.
:: The colon indicates the start of the loop block—the code that will run on each iteration.
** if char.isalnum() → Only keeps characters that are letters or digits (removes spaces, commas, etc.)
Example: 'A man, a plan' becomes 'amanaplan'

return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]
This checks if the cleaned string is the same forward and backward
** cleaned[::-1] is a Python trick that reverses the string
** cleaned[start:stop:step]
start: where the slice begins (default is start of the string)
stop: where the slice ends (default is end of the string)
step: how much to move forward (or backward) with each step
So if the string is equal to its reverse → it’s a palindrome

print(is_palindrome('a man, a plan , a canal , panama'))
This calls your is_palindrome() function with the input string
Then it prints the result: True if it is a palindrome, False if not
